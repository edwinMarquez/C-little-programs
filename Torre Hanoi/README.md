#Tower of Hanoi

------
<br>
This little program uses the SDL 1.2 library and SDL_image 1.2 to create the user interface
The recursive algorith was taken from a Pascal book, (I don't remember which one :( )<br>
I use some images from my brother  @SergioMrqUz
<br>
<br>
It starts in the console, there you choose the number of disks to use from 1 to 7. (Its in Spanish)
-----

Then it starts solving the tower<br>
